        I dove headfirst into the world of software development just six months
        ago, taking a daring leap from a career in finance to enroll in the
        Northcoders bootcamp. This bold journey demanded significant
        preparation, followed by 13 weeks of immersive learning and hands-on
        coding. Amid this exhilarating experience, I collaborated with diverse
        and talented individuals on both individual and team projects. From
        tackling coding challenges to building real-world applications, my
        passion for tech and risk-taking spirit fueled this transformative
        switch. Driven by a deep love for technology and the unwavering belief
        that this career shift was worth every moment.
