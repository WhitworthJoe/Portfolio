        I took the leap into software development just six
        months ago, leaving behind a career in finance to enroll in the
        Northcoders bootcamp. This journey not only demanded
        significant preparation but also included 13 weeks of immersive learning
        and hands-on coding. During this experience, I collaborated
        with diverse and talented individuals on team
        projects, tackling coding challenges and building real-world
        applications. One of my notable achievements during this time was
        building 'Resource Rivals' in just 7 days, where I demonstrated
        proficiency in Javascript, React, CSS and Socket.IO. This experience solidified
        my passion for technology and showcased my ability to adapt quickly to
        new environments. Coming from a finance background, I bring a unique
        perspective to software development, combining analytical skills with a
        creative problem-solving mindset. My journey into tech has reinforced my
        belief that this career shift was worth every moment. I am
        excited to contribute my skills and continue my learning journey in a
        dynamic and collaborative tech environment.
